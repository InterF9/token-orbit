Status: Scheduling started

We have started scheduling work for this project.

## Project Structure

- **Backend/** - Node.js/Express API server
- **Frontend/** - Frontend application (to be implemented)

## Backend Setup

The backend server is set up with:
- Express.js web framework
- CORS and Morgan middleware
- Environment variable configuration
- Organized folder structure (routes, controllers, models, etc.)

See [Backend/README.md](Backend/README.md) for setup and usage instructions.

## Next Steps
- Define scheduling requirements
- Implement scheduler in Backend/
- Integrate with Frontend/
